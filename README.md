# MLops_1

<!-- Implementing the Deep learning Project -->

 ## Project Overview
 The project is related to the vision 

 Create a pipeleine for the vision model

 we'll use the CNN for the vision model for image classification

 We'll do an image classification task using the CNN model

 we'll train our own model and finetune it inrelation to problem system
